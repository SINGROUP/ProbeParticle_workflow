ProbeParticle workflow for water and CO adsorption on Calcite
=============================================================

Reusable workflow to generate ProbeParticle images, as used in::

Install
-------

Clone the required git repositories::

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SINGROUP/ProbeParticle_workflow.git
```

Install python dependencies, using [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)::

```bash
pipenv sync
```

Enter the virtual environment using::

```bash
pipenv shell
```

Usage
-----

The workflow requires POSCAR, LOCAPOT and CHGCAR files from VASP simulation of the system. These files should be added to the `data` folder with the same prefix, as shown by "example" files.
The `workflow.ipynb` has the cells to add the workflow to an [ASE database](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html). 

> **_NOTE:_**  Add a vacuum of atleast 20Å over the system for better visualisation.

[Runner](https://runner.readthedocs.io) is used to run the workflow.
There are two ways to run the workflow once added to the database::
 * with a slurm workflow manager
 * with terminal.

Use the correct runner definition from the `workflow.ipynb` for your environment. Once added to the workflow, runner can be started by::

```bash
# for slurm runner
python run.py

# for terminal runner
python run_terminal.py
```

After the run finishes, the database is updated with the relevant data. This data can be retrieved by running the "data retrieval" cell in `workflow.ipynb`. This adds the relevant cells in the `Images` folder.

The `Images.ipynb` (in the `Images` folder) can be used to visualise the images generated from the ProbeParticle workflow.
